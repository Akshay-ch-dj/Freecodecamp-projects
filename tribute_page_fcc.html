        <h3 class="section-head">Time line of Michael Faraday's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1791 </strong>- Born in Newington Butts, London, he is the 3<sup>rd</sup> child in the 
                family, got only the most basic school education in childhood.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1805 </strong>- At the age of 14, he become an apprentice to George Riebau, a local bookbinder 
                and bookseller in Blandford Street, London. In his 7-year apprenticeship here, Faraday got a chance to 
                read many books, educated himself, also developed an interest in science.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1812 </strong>- At the age of 20 Faraday attended lectures by the eminent English chemist 
                Humphry Davy of Royal Institution, England, which set a turning point in his life. Faraday sent
                Davy his notes taken during the lectures, accompanied with a letter asking for employment in the field, 
                Davy got impressed by his scientific temper.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1813 </strong>- Davy employed Faraday as his assistant, later he elevated as a chemical 
                assistant at the Royal Institution. It is often jokingly said of Davy that Faraday was, in hindsight, 
                his greatest ever discovery.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1816 </strong>- Working with Davy in Chemistry, Faraday delivered chemistry lectures 
                for City philosophical society, which refined the quality of his lectures.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1820 </strong>- Faraday himself had become one of the world's most premier chemists of the 
                time. His labors under Davy had given him a vast amount of experience, Faraday set out on his own works. 
                He succeeded in creating the first known compounds of chlorine and carbon C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>
                and C<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1821 </strong>- Faraday married Sarah Barnard, same year for further experimenting Davy's 
                research about electricity and magnetism, Faraday build two devices to produce what he called 
                "electromagnetic rotation"- laid the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology, but due to a
                misunderstanding between Davy and Faraday he did not able to continue his work.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1823 </strong>- Michael Faraday succeeded liquefaction of ammonia(built on the ideas of John 
                Dalton), notices the cooling effect when ammonia evaporates. Faraday's work had shown that mechanical 
                pumps could be used to turn gas to liquid at room temperature, this laid a milestone in the development 
                of modern refrigeration techniques.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1824 </strong>- He made experiments that perfected the Bunsen burner. Also as a fact, The first 
                rubber balloons were made by him for use in his experiments with hydrogen at the Royal Institution.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1825 </strong>- Michael was working on illuminating gases and succeeded in isolating and
                describing something that would later be known as benzene. Around this time he also helped lay down 
                the foundations of metallurgy and metallography whilst conducting investigations into steel alloys.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>1826 </strong>- He worked on an assignment by the Royal Society into improving the quality of
                glasses and telescopes, succeeded in producing a very high refractive index that would later help him
                discover diamagnetism.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1831 </strong>- After the death of Davy, he continued his series of experiments that led to the
                discovery of Electromagnetic Induction, he also experimented in Mutual Induction( which later modelled 
                mathematically by Maxwell), using his iron-ring-coil apparatus, it can be considered as an initial model 
                of Transformer, later he discovered Electric Dynamo, ancestor of modern power generator and electric
                motor.
                </li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1832 </strong>- In the apex period of his scientific excellence, he turned down all the offered 
                honors said he preferred to live "plain Mr. Faraday till the End". </li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1833 </strong>- Based on the electrochemical research he published Faraday's laws of 
                electrolysis, also invented the system of oxidation numbers, and popularized terminology such as 
                anode, cathode, electrode, and ion.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1836 </strong>- Invented Faraday Cage - enclosure used to block electromagnetic fields, the idea 
                found extensive use even in today's sensible electronic equipment protection, microwaves etc.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1839 </strong>- Concept of lines of Flux, which is a crucial idea helped in the coming age 
                developments in Electromagnetism. </li>
                <br>
                
            <li><strong>1845 </strong>- Discovered Diamagnetism and magneto-optical effect, today known as the Faraday 
                effect.(rotation of plane polarized light with magnetic field).</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1848 </strong>- The famous lecture of "chemical history of a candle" - one of his 19 Christmas 
                lectures, started in 1925 to present science to general people. The joyful lectures showcasing
                experiments and deep philosophies helped developing scientific thinking in people, and still given in 
                the Royal Institution every year.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1858 </strong>- Retired from Royal Institution to live in the Master Mason's house which later
                called Faraday house.</li>
                <br>
            <li><strong>1867 </strong>- Died in 1867 at the age of 75. He had previously turned down burial in 
                Westminster Abbey, but he has a memorial plaque there, near Isaac Newton's tomb. The unit of 
                capacitance, Farad, given in honor of Michael Faraday.</li>

        <p id="end-para"> Michael Faraday was a highly influential British scientist who in part turned electricity
            into something that could be harnessed for work, his works ultimately lead to our modern-day
            understanding of electromagnetism. He is one of history's most accomplished experimental scientists,
            Albert Einstein actually kept photos of three scientists in his office.. Isaac Newton,
            James Clerk Maxwell and, Michael Faraday. </p>
